# queueing_simulation
analytical simulator model for open queuing network systems (Jackson Networks) using the open-source process-based discrete event simulation package, SimPy. This simulator model analyses the performance of a configuration of virtual machines (VMs) for a workload of jobs arriving at a queuing network system.
